## 2. Information We Collect

We may collect the following categories of information:

- **Account and profile information** – name or display name, email address, password (stored in hashed form), profile photo if you upload one, and subscription or account status.

- **Boat and usage data you provide** – boat profile information (e.g. boat name, make/model, dimensions), engine and equipment details, maintenance and service logs, navigation notes, trip logs, calendar entries, and uploaded documents or photos related to your vessel.

- **Usage and device information** – device type, operating system and app version, unique device identifiers, IP address, pages or screens viewed, actions taken in the app, and crash or diagnostic information to improve performance.

- **Location information (if enabled)** – approximate or precise location if you grant the app permission. You can control this in your device settings.

- **Communication information** – details you provide when contacting us (e.g. support requests or feedback).

We do **not** intentionally collect sensitive personal data (such as health or financial account numbers) unless you choose to provide it. We encourage you not to share more personal data than is necessary to use the Services.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide and maintain the Services** – create and manage your account, store and display your boat and maintenance information, sync data across devices, and provide calendar, logging, and reminder features.

- **Improve and personalise the Services** – understand how users interact with the app to improve design, features, and performance, and to tailor content related to your boats and maintenance.

- **Communicate with you** – send administrative messages (e.g. account confirmations, security alerts), respond to your enquiries, and, where you have agreed, send updates about new features or offers (you may opt out of marketing at any time).

- **Security and fraud prevention** – monitor, prevent, and detect fraudulent or unauthorised activity and protect the security of our Services and users.

- **Comply with legal obligations** – respond to lawful requests from authorities and meet our legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.

Under Jersey data protection law we process your personal data only where we have a valid legal basis, such as your consent, performance of a contract with you, compliance with a legal obligation, or our legitimate interests (e.g. improving and securing the Services).

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We do **not** sell your personal information.

We may share your information:

- **With service providers** – third-party vendors that provide hosting, databases, analytics, email delivery, or similar services on our behalf. They may process your data only to perform services for us and must protect it appropriately.

- **When you choose to share** – if the app allows you to share boat details, logs, or other content with other users or services, we will share it as you instruct through those features.

- **Business transfers** – in connection with a merger, sale of assets, financing, or acquisition of our business, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to confidentiality protections.

- **Legal requirements** – when required by law or to respond to valid requests from public authorities, or to protect our rights, property, safety, or that of our users or the public.

---

## 5. International Transfers

Your information may be stored and processed in countries outside Jersey (for example, where our hosting or database providers operate). Those countries may have different data protection laws.

Where we transfer personal data outside Jersey, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as Jersey-approved standard contractual clauses or adequacy decisions, as required by Jersey law.

---

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to:

- Provide and maintain the Services;
- Fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;
- Comply with our legal obligations (e.g. tax, accounting, or regulatory);
- Resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

When we no longer need your personal information, we will delete or anonymise it. Where deletion is not immediately possible (e.g. in backups), we will store it securely and isolate it from further processing until it can be deleted.

## 7. Your Rights (Jersey)

Under Jersey data protection law (the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018), you have rights including:

- **Access** – to request a copy of your personal data we hold.
- **Rectification** – to request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.
- **Erasure** – to request deletion of your personal data in certain circumstances.

- **Withdraw consent** – where we rely on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at **Pmdonkeylabs@gmail.com**. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the **Jersey Office of the Information Commissioner (JOIC)** if you believe we have not handled your personal data properly. You can find their details at [jerseyoic.org](https://jerseyoic.org).

## 10. Security

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, including encryption in transit (e.g. HTTPS), access controls, and regular updates.

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will change the "Last updated" date at the top. We may also notify you of significant changes via the app or by email where appropriate.
