## Recommended Implementation

For the app icon, I recommend **Concept 1 (Compass Rose + Wave)** as it:
- Clearly represents navigation and marine themes
- Is instantly recognizable
- Works well at small sizes
- Matches the in-app logo design
- Feels premium and professional

The icon should be designed at multiple sizes:
- 1024x1024 (App Store)
- 512x512 (Google Play)
- 192x192 (Android)
- 180x180 (iOS)

All concepts use the same color palette as the UI for brand consistency.
