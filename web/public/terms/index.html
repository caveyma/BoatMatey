  <h1>BoatMatey Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 11 February 2026</p>

  <p>BoatMatey is provided by <strong>Donkey Labs</strong>, which holds a Jersey business licence for software and mobile app development, digital subscription services (SaaS), and online platform management.</p>

  <p>These Terms of Use ("<strong>Terms</strong>") govern your use of the <strong>BoatMatey</strong> mobile and web applications and related services (the "<strong>Services</strong>") operated by Donkey Labs ("<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Eligibility and Account</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use the Services. By using the Services, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the authority to enter into these Terms.</p>
  <p>When you create an account or subscribe, you agree to provide accurate and complete information and to keep it up to date. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. You must notify us promptly of any unauthorised use of your account.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. Subscription and Payment</h2>
  <p>Access to certain features of BoatMatey requires a paid subscription. By subscribing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You agree to pay the subscription fee (e.g. GBP 29.99/year (£29.99/year including VAT where applicable), or the price displayed at the time of purchase) in accordance with the App Store or Google Play terms.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions may include a free trial; you may be charged when the trial ends unless you cancel before then.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled in your device's store subscription settings. Refunds are handled by Apple or Google in line with their policies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not process payments directly; payment and billing are handled by the applicable app store. Your use of the Services may also be subject to the app store's terms and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions</a> (or equivalent) where applicable.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. Your Content and Licence</h2>
  <p>You retain ownership of any content you submit or upload through the Services (e.g. boat details, logs, photos, documents). By submitting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide licence to use, store, process, and display that content as necessary to provide, operate, and improve the Services (including syncing across your devices and backing up data).</p>
  <p>You are solely responsible for your content. You represent that you have all rights needed to provide it and that it does not infringe any third party's rights or violate any applicable law. We may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or the law, but we have no obligation to monitor or review content.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of others or restrict their use of the Services. You must not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Services for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.</li>
    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorised access to our systems, other accounts, or any data not intended for you.</li>
    <li>Transmit malware, spam, or any content that could harm the Services or other users.</li>
    <li>Resell, redistribute, or commercially exploit the Services or content except as permitted by these Terms.</li>
    <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code from the Services (except to the extent permitted by applicable law).</li>
    <li>Use automated means (e.g. bots, scrapers) to access the Services without our prior written consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if we reasonably believe you have breached these Terms.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>We (and our licensors) own all rights in the Services, including the BoatMatey name, logos, design, and any software, text, and materials we provide. Nothing in these Terms grants you any right to use our trademarks or other intellectual property except as necessary to use the Services in accordance with these Terms. You may not copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Services or our content without our prior written consent.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Termination and Effect</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the Services at any time. You may also delete your account via the in-app settings; our <a href="https://boatmatey.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> describes how we handle your data on account deletion.</p>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services (or your account) if you breach these Terms, for operational or legal reasons, or otherwise at our discretion. Where we terminate for breach, we are not obliged to refund any unused portion of your subscription; refunds remain subject to the app store's policies. Where the law allows, we are not liable to you for any suspension or termination.</p>
  <p>On termination, your right to use the Services ceases immediately. Sections that by their nature should survive (including Limitation of Liability, Indemnity, Governing Law, and General) will survive termination.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
  <p>The Services may integrate with or link to third-party services (e.g. app stores, mapping or documentation tools). We do not control those services and are not responsible for their terms, privacy practices, or content. Your use of them is at your own risk. Where the Services are distributed through the Apple App Store or Google Play, your use may also be subject to those platforms' terms.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>8. No Marine or Professional Advice</h2>
  <p>The Services provide general information and convenience tools only. They are not a substitute for professional marine, mechanical, survey, insurance, or legal advice. Always consult qualified professionals for maintenance, safety, compliance, and legal matters relating to your vessel. Any information in the app (including maintenance reminders, logs, boat details, and documents) may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated. Do not rely on it for safety-critical or legal decisions. You use such content at your own risk.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>9. Specific Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>To the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee and are not responsible for the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reminders and notifications</strong> – We do not guarantee that maintenance reminders, calendar alerts, or notifications will be delivered, displayed, or seen by you. The Services may fail to notify you due to device settings, connectivity, or technical issues. Do not rely solely on the app for time-sensitive or safety-critical maintenance or compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Boat data, logs, and documents</strong> – Information you enter or that is shown in the app (boat details, maintenance logs, fuel and electrical records, documents, and notes) may be recorded, stored, or displayed incorrectly due to technical or human error. You should verify important data and keep your own records where it matters. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or availability of your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Service availability</strong> – The Services may be unavailable, slow, or interrupted due to maintenance, outages, or other reasons. We do not guarantee uptime or continuous access.</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy of information</strong> – All content and features are for convenience only. We do not guarantee that any information (including third-party data) is accurate, complete, or up to date. You are responsible for verifying information and for your vessel's safety and compliance with applicable maritime or boating regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party data and tools</strong> – Data from mapping, documentation, or other third-party services may be inaccurate or out of date. We do not control and are not responsible for such data. Always confirm important information from authoritative sources.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You use the Services and rely on any of their content or features at your own risk. Where the law allows, we are not liable for any loss or damage arising from the above.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>To the extent permitted by law, the Services and all content and features are provided "<strong>as is</strong>" and "<strong>as available</strong>". We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or fit for any particular purpose. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, except those that cannot be excluded by law. Your use of the Services is at your own risk.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We (and our directors, employees, and affiliates) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Services.</li>
    <li>We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from: reliance on maintenance reminders, logs, or other data; failure of reminders or notifications to be delivered or seen; inaccurate or missing information; Service downtime or unavailability; decisions you make based on the Services (including about maintenance, safety, or vessel operation); or your failure to maintain or comply with maritime or boating regulations.</li>
    <li>Our total liability to you for any claims arising from or related to the Services or these Terms shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim (or, if no payment was made, zero).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law.</p>
  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or liabilities; in such jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>12. Indemnity</h2>
  <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Donkey Labs and its directors, employees, and affiliates from and against any claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Services, your content, or your breach of these Terms.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>13. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Jersey. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Jersey, to the extent permitted by law. If you live in another country, the law there may give you mandatory rights that apply regardless of this choice; in that case, those rights are unaffected. Your use of the Apple App Store or Google Play is also subject to Apple's or Google's respective terms, which apply to the distribution of the app.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>14. General</h2>
  <p>These Terms, together with our <a href="https://boatmatey.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and any other policies we publish in the app or on our website, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services. If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts will remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision does not waive that right or provision. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms; you may not assign without our prior written consent.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>15. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the Services after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We may notify you of material changes via the app or by email where appropriate. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Services.</p>
